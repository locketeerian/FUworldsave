[23:48:50.163] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> The sun has set, and the temperature has blissfully dropped to tolerable levels. You should be relatively comfortable until daybreak.
[23:57:42.412] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> The sun is rising, bringing another blistering hot day. Take care, and be aware that the brighter it gets, the worse things will become.
[00:01:13.210] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> You've managed to cool off in this wonderful pool of liquid. You feel much less uncomfortable now!
[00:01:21.621] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> At its brightest, the sun here is extremely uncomfortable. Until it gets into the afternoon, expect to suffer a bit more.
